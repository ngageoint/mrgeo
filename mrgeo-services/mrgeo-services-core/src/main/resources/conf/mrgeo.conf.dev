# Memory intensive (Spark) job memory multiplier.  This parameter specifies a multiplier for the
# amount of memory to give to memory intensive jobs.  For example, if YARN was configured to give
# 2G (2048m) to a job, a multiplier of 2 would yield 4G, 1.5 would yield 3G.  The total number of
# concurrent tasks will be be lowered by the appripriate amount
memoryintensive.multiplier=2

# This is the maximum amount of memory to give to the workers for mrgeo processing.  Any memory
# above this will be allocated to Spark shuffle and cache, based on the shuffle.fraction property.
# The calculations WILL NOT kick in until there is twice the memory as max.processing.memory.  If
# the worker memory is less than twice max.processing.memory, 1/2 will go to processing, and the
# rest will be distributed to shuffle and storage based on the shuffle fraction.
# For example, if max.processing.memory is 1G, when the worker reaches 2G or more, 1G will be allocated
# to mrgeo for processing and the rest allocated to shuffle & storage.

# MrGeo Publishing Profiles
# Each profile should have a name, preceded by mrgeo.publisher.  The prefix and the profile name should precede the
# properties for that profile.  Currently MrGeo will publish the image to all profiles if the publishImage option
# passed to the save mapop is true.  Profiles may contain encrypted properties, such as passwords.  Properties can be
# encrypted with the encrypt script.  Encrypted property values should be surrounded by ENC() The master password used
# to encrypt properties should be passed in at runtime as a system property
# (i.e. -Dmrgeo.encryption.masterPassword=<masterPassword>).


# Geoserver Publishing Profiles
# Profiles may be configured to publish images to a Geoserver instance via the geoserver REST interface.  The following
# properties are required for any geoserver publishing profile
#
# Geoserver Base URL - Should be the Geoserver url up to and including the rest/ part.  See the example below
# mrgeo.publisher.localGeoserver.geoserverUrl = http://localhost:8085/geoserver/rest
#
# Geoserver Username
# mrgeo.publisher.localGeoserver.geoserverUsername = admin
#
# Geoserver Password - This will likley be encrypted in production but may be unencrypted in development
# mrgeo.publisher.localGeoserver.geoserverPassword = geoserver
#
# The following properties are optional for a geoserver publishing profile
#
# Workspace - The workspace to publish images to.  It will be created if it does not exist.
# mrgeo.publisher.localGeoserver.workspace = mrgeo-workspace
#
# Coverage Store Name - The name of the coverage store to publish images to.  It will be created if it does not exist.
# mrgeo.publisher.localGeoserver.coverageStore.name = mrgeo-coverage-store
#
# Coverage Store Description - A description of the coverage store
# mrgeo.publisher.localGeoserver.coverageStore.description = "MrGeo data source, automatically (periodically) updated with new layers"
#
# Coverage Store Type - The type of the coverage store to publish images to.  This is used by geoserver to create the
# correct reader for the coverages.  Recommend not setting this and let it use the default.
# mrgeo.publisher.localGeoserver.coverageStore.type = MrGeo
#
# Coverage Store Name - The MrGeo config file the reader should use.  Typically, this will be the default "mrgeo.config",
# located in the MRGEO_HOME directory but a path or a URL to a config file may be specified
# mrgeo.publisher.localGeoserver.coverageStore.configUrl = mrgeo.config
