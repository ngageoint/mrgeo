##Origin

MrGeo was developed at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in collaboration with [DigitalGlobe](https://www.digitalglobe.com/). The government has ["unlimited rights"](https://github.com/ngageoint/mrgeo/blob/master/NOTICE) and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions.

###MrGeo Overview

MrGeo (MapReduce Geo) is a geospatial toolkit designed to provide raster-based geospatial capabilities that can be performed at scale. MrGeo is built upon the Hadoop ecosystem to leverage the storage and processing of 100+ commodity computers.  Functionally,  MrGeo stores large raster datasets as a collection of individual tiles stored in Hadoop to enable large-scale data and analytic services.  The co-location of data and analytics offers the advantage of minimizing the movement of data  in favor of bringing the computation to the data; a more favorable compute method for Geospatial Big Data. This framework has enabled the servicing of terabyte scale raster databases and  performed terrain analytics on databases exceeding 100+ gigabytes in size.

Unique features/solutions of MrGeo:

* Scalable storage and processing of raster data
* Application ready data: data is stored in MrGeo in a format that is ready for computation, eliminating several data pre-processing steps from production workflows.
* A suite of robust suite of MapReduce analytics that that include algebraic math operations, focal operations(i.e. slope), and graph operations (cost distance)
* A third generation data storage model that 
  * Maintains data locality via  spatial indexing. 
  * An abstraction layer between the MapReduce analytics and storage methods to enable a diverse set of cloud storage options such as HDFS, Accumulo, HBASE etc.
* A Map algebra interface that enables the development of custom algorithms in a simple scripting API
*	A plugin architecture that facilitates a modular software development and deployment strategies
*	Data and Analytic capabilities provisioned by OGC and REST service end points

Exemplar MrGeo Use Cases:

*	Raster Storage and Provisioning:  MrGeo has been used to store, index, tile, and pyramid multi-terabyte scale image databases.  Once stored, this data is  made available through simple Tiled Map Services (TMS) and or Web Mapping Services (WMS).
*	Large Scale Batch Processing and Serving:  MrGeo has been used to pre-compute global 1 ArcSecond (nominally 30 meters) elevation data (300+ GB) into derivative raster products : slope, aspect, relative elevation, terrain shaded relief (collectively terabytes in size)
*	Global Computation of Cost Distance:  Given all pub locations in OpenStreetMap, compute 2 hour drive  times from each location.  The full resolution is  1 ArcSecond (30 meters nominally)
